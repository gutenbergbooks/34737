<p class="h2">HOW TO USE THIS BOOK</p>

<hr />

<p class="noindent">THIS book is one of a series known as the CHILD'S OWN
BOOK OF GREAT MUSICIANS, written by Thomas
Tapper, author of "Pictures from the Lives of the Great Composers
for Children," "Music Talks with Children," "First
Studies in Music Biography," and others.</p>

<p>The sheet of illustrations included herewith is to be cut
apart by the child, and each illustration is to be inserted in its
proper place throughout the book, pasted in the space containing
the same number as will be found under each picture on the
sheet. It is not necessary to cover the entire back of a picture
with paste. Put it only on the corners and place neatly within
the lines you will find printed around each space. Use photographic
paste, if possible.</p>

<p>After this play-work is completed there will be found at
the back of the book blank pages upon which the child is to
write his own story of the great musician, based upon the facts
and questions found on the previous pages.</p>

<p>The book is then to be sewed by the child through the
center with the cord found in the enclosed envelope. The book
thus becomes the child's own book.</p>

<p>This series will be found not only to furnish a pleasing and
interesting task for the children, but will teach them the main
facts with regard to the life of each of the great musicians&mdash;an
educational feature worth while.</p>

<hr />

<p>This series of the Child's Own Book of Great Musicians
includes at present a book on each of the following:</p>

<p class="h2">The Story of a Little Boy who was
Forced to Practice</p>

<p>Ludwig van Beethoven was born in the lovely
town of Bonn, on the River Rhine, December 16, 1770.</p>

<p>The house in which he spent his boyhood is still
standing. We see in the picture what a pretty, homelike
place the house and the yard must have been. It
is now the Beethoven House, or Museum, filled with
mementos of the great composer. There you may see
music pages written by him, letters, medals, instruments;
even his ear trumpet is there.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<span class="caption">THE BEETHOVEN HOUSE</span>
</div>

<p>Beethoven's father was a singer
at the Chapel of the Elector. He
was not a good father, for he did
not care to work even enough to
make his family comfortable.
But the mother loved her boy
with all her heart, as we shall see.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus03.jpg"  alt="BEETHOVEN&#39;S FATHER" title="BEETHOVEN&#39;S FATHER" /><br />
<span class="caption">BEETHOVEN&#39;S FATHER</span>
</div>

<p>Ludwig was only four years old
when he began to study music.
Like children of to-day he shed
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;4]</span>
many a tear over the first lessons. In the beginning his
father taught him piano and violin, and forced him
to practice. At school he learned, just as we do to-day,
reading, writing, arithmetic, and later on, Latin.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus04.jpg"  alt="THE FIRST LESSON"
title="THE FIRST LESSON" /><br />
<span class="caption">THE FIRST LESSON</span>
</div>

<p>Never again after thirteen, did Ludwig go to
school for he had to work and earn his living.</p>

<p>Do you wonder what kind of a boy he was?</p>

<p>We are told that he was shy and quiet. He talked
little and took no interest in the games that his boy
and girl companions played.</p>

<p>While Ludwig was in school he played at a concert
for the first time. He was then eight years old.
Two years later he had composed quite a number of
pieces. One of these was printed. It was called
<i>Variations on Dressler's March</i>. On the title page of
this piece it said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="bbox">
<p class="noindentcenter">VARIATIONS ON DRESSLER'S MARCH<br />
Composed by a Young Amateur<br />
LOUIS VAN BEETHOVEN<br />
Aged ten years. 1780</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;5]</span>
Then the little boy studied with a teacher named
Christian Gottlob Neefe, who took real interest in
him. Neefe did not, as was said of Beethoven's father,
punish the little boy severely to keep him at his practice,
hour after hour.</p>

<p>Often when Neefe had to travel Ludwig took his
teacher's place as organist at the Court. Then with
the organ lessons there were other lessons in Harmony.
So rapidly did the boy improve that his
teacher said one day:</p>

<p>"If he goes on as he has begun, he will some day
be a second Mozart."</p>

<p>Our young hero of thirteen was surely busy every
hour of the day. He played in an orchestra, as accompanist.
He gave lessons, played the organ in church,
studied the violin, and kept up his work in composition.
He always kept a note-book for musical ideas.</p>

<p>Most every child in
these days has more and
better opportunities than
had the great Beethoven
when he was a child.
Here is a picture of the
funny old organ in the
Minorite Church of Bonn
upon which Beethoven
played when he was a little
boy.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus05.jpg"  alt="BEETHOVEN&#39;S ORGAN" title="BEETHOVEN&#39;S ORGAN" /><br />
<span class="caption">BEETHOVEN&#39;S ORGAN</span>
</div>

<p>Look at the funny stops
at the top and compare it
with the best organ in
your own town. This is
little better than a toy beside
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;6]</span>
our fine organs of to-day,&mdash;yet it was the best
that Beethoven had to practice upon.
When Neefe said that he would probably be a
second Mozart the words filled Ludwig with a great
desire. On his sixteenth birthday what do you think
happened? Why, he set out from Bonn to Vienna,
where Mozart lived.</p>

<p>But scarcely had he begun to feel at home in
Vienna when news came to him that his mother was
ill. She had always been a good mother, kind of heart,
great of hope for her little boy, and probably she
sympathized with the hard lot that made him have to
work so early in life. When he learned of her sickness
he hastened to Bonn.</p>

<p>Who was happier, he said to one of his friends,
than I, so long as I was able to speak the sweet name
of Mother and know that she heard me?</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus06.jpg"  alt="BEETHOVEN&#39;S MOTHER" title="BEETHOVEN&#39;S MOTHER" /><br />
<span class="caption">BEETHOVEN&#39;S MOTHER</span>
</div>

<p>Vienna had given him a wonderful happiness.
He met Mozart and had some lessons from him in
composition. When he played for the great master,
Mozart tip-toed from the room and said softly to
those present:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;7]</span>
"Pay heed to this boy. He will surely make a
noise in the world some day."</p>

<span class="caption">BEETHOVEN AND MOZART</span>
</div>

<p>After his Mother's death he determined that he
would remain there. And it was not until he talked
with Joseph Haydn, who stopped at Bonn on his way
to London, that he decided once more to journey to
Vienna. Beethoven was twenty-two years old at the
time he met Papa Haydn. Beethoven showed the
master some of his compositions. Haydn urged him
to go at once to Vienna, promising to give him lessons
in composition on his return from London.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;8]</span>
Everywhere in Vienna Beethoven was a welcome
guest. He was proud (but in the right way), very
honest, always straightforward and independent.

But, like his mother, he was warm-hearted and as
true as could be. There was nothing in his nature
that was mean, or cruel, or wrong in any way. He
took pride in his talent and worked hard to perfect
himself in it.</p>

<p>Here is what Beethoven's handwriting looked
like.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>Bit by bit, the great power of Beethoven as a
pianist became known. He played much among his
friends, but he did not like to perform in public.</p>

<p>A story is told that once he was to play his C major
Concerto at a concert. When he arrived at the hall
he found the piano was tuned so low that he had to
play the Concerto in C# major.</p>

<p>You know how hard it is to transpose a simple
piece, but think of transposing a Concerto and playing
it with orchestra without time for practice!</p>

<p>Do you sometimes wonder what the great composer
looked like? Beethoven lived outside of Vienna
and often took long walks in the country. Once a
little boy ten years of age was taken by his father to
visit Beethoven. The boy must have been a very observant
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;9]</span>
boy for he wrote out a description of how
Beethoven looked. This is the little boy's picture as
a man:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus10.jpg"  alt="CARL CZERNY" title="CARL CZERNY" /><br />
<span class="caption">CARL CZERNY</span>
</div>

<p>And this is the description he gave of Beethoven.</p>

<p>"Beethoven was dressed in a dark gray jacket and
trousers of some long-haired material, which reminded
me of the description of Robinson Crusoe I
had just been reading. The jet-black hair stood upright
on his head. A beard, unshaven for several
days, made still darker his naturally swarthy face. I
noticed also, with a child's quick perception, that he
had cotton wool which seemed to have been dipped
in some yellow fluid in both ears. His hands were covered
with hair, and the fingers were very broad, especially
at the tips."</p>

<p>You know, of course, that when we think of music
we think of <i>hearing</i> it. We think how it <i>sounds</i> to us.
A lover of music loves
to hear its <i>tones</i> and to feel
its <i>rhythm</i>.</p>

<p>Like every other human being, Beethoven loved
music in just this way. He loved its sounds as they
fell on the ear. As colors delight our eyes, so tones
fell with delight upon the ears of this man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;10]</span>Beethoven was once
invited to play at the
home of a nobleman,
but upon being informed
that he would be
expected to go as a
menial, he indignantly
rejected the proposal.</p>

<span class="caption">THE ANGRY BEETHOVEN</span>
</div>

<p>Beethoven had many
friends and was fond
of them. They knew
that he was a genius
and were glad to forget
some of the very
strange things that he
did when he got angry. Here is a picture of the great
master seated among a group of his friends. Although
Beethoven was odd, his friends loved him.</p>

<span class="caption">BEETHOVEN PLAYING FOR HIS FRIENDS</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;11]</span>
But a strange Fate touched him and took away
his sense of hearing. From the time he was about
thirty years old his hearing grew gradually worse.
Indeed it was necessary for him to have a piano especially
constructed with additional wires so that he
could hear.</p>

Can you think of anything more cruel, more
terrible, more depressing, more awful?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;12]</span>
And yet he went on day, after day, composing
beautiful music as he walked the fields, or as he sat
at his table. For we must remember that he could
hear his own music in his thoughts. That is, the mind
that made the music could hear it, though the ear itself
was forever closed to the sound of it.</p>

<p>Year after year he continued to write symphonies
and concertos, sonatas, songs, choral and chamber
music.</p>

<p>And year after year the poor ears closed a little
more and still a little more, until finally not even the
loudest noises could penetrate them.</p>

<p>And yet he worked bravely; writing every beautiful
music thought that came to him, so that the
world, and that means you and all of us, might have
them. When Beethoven was dying in 1827, Schubert
called upon him and remained with him for some time.</p>
